      "paragraph": [
        "The carbon intensity of electricity is a measure of how much CO₂ is emitted for each unit of electricity consumed.",
        "This is important because it helps us understand the environmental impact of our electricity consumption, depending on what fuel sources are used to generate it at any given point in time.",
        "For example, if the carbon intensity value is high (>500) its a good time to avoid using electricity, or to use it more efficiently, as the electricity you are using is likely to be coming from a high carbon source like coal or gas.",
        "Knowing what the current and likely future carbon intensity is can help you make more informed decisions about when to use electricity in order to reduce your carbon footprint."

    "forecastSection": {
      "title": "Why do you need a forecast?",
      "paragraph": [
        "The value given for carbon intensity on the grid right now is a forecast mainly because the data sources we use are not real time.",
        "It comes from the Grid Operator Website as historical data, which lag real time by about 2 hours, depending on the utility, from this data we then make a prediction around 3 hours into the future.",
        "Generation plans, and real time energy system data, by generation source, is not publicly available in Japan, so we as a 3rd party have to make a reasonable prediction.",
        "As this project develops, we hope to improve our predictions, but more than this, we hope that Japanese energy utilties will make available the required data in real time so that this number is not a prediction, but fact."

    "howSection": {
      "title": "How is the Carbon Intensity calculated?",
      "paragraph": [
        "The carbon intensity is calculated for a given period by figuring out the proportion of energy generation that came from each fuel type.",
        "This proportion is then multiplied by the Carbon Intensity for that fuel type, for example, the carbon intensity factor for coal is 937 gCO₂/kWh with Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) having a factor of 394 gCO₂/kWh.",
        "This isn't perfect, as each generating plant is likely to have a different carbon intensity factor, which changes over the course of the year.",
        "Additionaly, before February 2024, the data used by this tool - which is provided by Japanese utility companies - considers all Fossil Fuels under one heading 'Thermal Generation', so with the data, we couldn't tell what kinds of fuel were being burned during that period.",
        "This make calculating a good carbon intensity figure before then even more challenging, as we have to use other reporting and sources to try and figure out the average contribution of each fuel source."
